                <p class="intro">The word may sound intimidating, but it’s actually really simple: cybersecurity just means protecting yourself and your information online. You can’t protect yourself from every threat out there – online or off. But you can definitely minimize your risk with some awareness and common sense.</p>

                <p>This PBS Nova Labs video offers great background on cybersecurity:</p>

                <h3>The Three Watch-Outs</h3>
                <p>Protecting yourself starts with knowing what to look out for. Here’s a quick rundown of the three most common cybersecurity threats:</p>

                <ul class="icon-list">
                  <li>
                    <h4>Manipulation</h4>
                    <p>Malicious hackers have come up with all kinds of tricks to steal and exploit your personal information. Examples include phishing (e.g. a fake bank email asking for your personal information), spamming, hacked accounts and the classic “Nigerian Prince” email (also called a “419 scam”). Healthy skepticism is your best friend on this front.</p>
                    <p><a href="#" class="go">Test your phishing knowledge</a></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Malware</h4>
                    <p>Viruses, worms, Trojan horses... These nasty little programs are designed to infect your machine to cause damage, steal personal information, spy or force ads on you. Avoiding malware means being smart about where you click.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Network and Computer Attacks</h4>
                    <p>Websites and networks are inherently vulnerable to attacks, ranging from the simple to the very sophisticated. If zero-day exploits and packet sniffing sound like obscure football plays to you, you’re not alone. Visit our cybersecurity glossary on Shape of the Web to nerd out on security terms and techniques. This threat is the hardest to prevent. But you can put a few more barriers between yourself and the attacker.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

              </div>

              <aside class="pullquote">
                <p class="quote">I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time&hellip; like tears in rain.</p>

          </section>

          <section id="act" class="section section-act">
            <div class="container">
              <h2 class="section-title">Build Your Safety Net</h2>

              <div class="main-column">
                <p class="intro">You don’t have to run your own server or know your way around advanced settings to increase your security. And you don’t have to give up on the Web, either. Before you start sending messages by carrier pigeon or stuffing your cash under the mattress, try these simple safety measures.</p>

                <h3>Look Both Ways</h3>
                <p>The first and most important thing is just to pay close attention to where and when you click.</p>

                <ul class="icon-list">
                  <li>
                    <h4>Trust your gut.</h4>
                    <p>If a link or download doesn’t feel quite right, it probably isn’t. Make sure you install programs only from verified trusted sources. Don’t click on anything that looks even remotely suspicious – even when you believe you know the source. It’s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Watch yourself in public.</h4>
                    <p>When you navigate the Web on a public WiFi network, anyone who chooses to snoop can see the contents of your activity, where you sent it from and to whom it’s addressed. Limit your exposure by refraining from sensitive activities when surfing on public Wi-Fi networks – or use encryption [link to smart on surveillance - act tab]. And before you share any kind of info online, think about how it might make you vulnerable.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Lock Your Doors</h3>
                <p>Strong password practices are your single best protection against almost every kind of threat on the Web.</p>

                <ul class="icon-list">
                  <li>
                    <h4>Protect your accounts and devices with a strong PIN or password.</h4>
                    <p>Everything you use should be protected with a password – and we don’t mean your birthdate, your address or “password”. Here are some tips for creating a strong password. To keep your accounts and devices a safe as possible, change your passwords at least once a year. It’s just like spring cleaning, except you don’t have to get up from your desk.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Don't use a single password everywhere.</h4>
                    <p>Using the same password for every site is like using the same key for your front door, your car, your safety deposit box and your kid's backpack – you just wouldn’t do it. Use a password manager to keep track instead.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>For the best protection, activate 2-step authentication wherever possible. <a href="#" class="go">Find out more</a></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Here’s what to do if you think your account has been compromised.</a></p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fix it Before it Breaks</h3>
                <p>Software updates are like oil changes ­– they can be a hassle in the moment, but a lifesaver in hindsight. Keep your devices and applications updated to make sure you’re taking advantage of developers’ latest security enhancements.</p>

                  stuff goes here
                </div>

                <h3>Install a Security System</h3>
                <p>Now that you’ve handled the basics, set the alarm. These programs prevent and protect against cyber intruders.</p>

                <ul class="icon-list">
                  <li>
                    <h4>Anti-virus software</h4>
                    <p>It won’t protect against everything, but it’s a good start. Here are two free options:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="#" class="go">AVG</a></li>
                      <li><a href="#" class="go">BitDefender</a></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Firefox Add-ons</h4>
                    <p>These add-ons will help you identify what you’re clicking before you click:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="#" class="go">Long URL please</a></li>
                      <li><a href="#" class="go">URL Tooltip</a></li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
