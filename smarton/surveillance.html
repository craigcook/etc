              <h2 class="section-title">What is government surveillance?</h2>
              <div class="main-column">
                <p class="intro">Stakeouts aren’t just the stuff of movies and TV — they’ve long been an essential tool for law enforcement and national security. The difference now is that stakeouts are no longer confined to bugs, binoculars and bad guys: surveillance has gone digital. All that data we generate through our daily activities online allows governments to keep an eye on lots and lots of people at once, in hopes of catching the ones who are up to no good. It’s like grabbing a giant haystack just in case there might be a needle inside.</p>

                <figure class="video">
                  <img src="media/img/greenwald.jpg" alt="">
                </figure>

                <h3>Stored information is vulnerable information</h3>
                <p>In order to tailor personal experiences for you – like getting directions, managing emails, connecting phone calls and sending relevant coupons – virtually every technology company you interact with collects and stores some amount of your personal information. But companies can be forced to turn over that information to governments, making private information not quite so private.</p>

                <p>Technology companies can be proactive in protecting users’ information. Mozilla’s data handling principles are designed for this purpose: limiting data collection to what’s needed, making data anonymous where possible, and deleting data when it’s no longer necessary. We follow these steps and encourage other companies to do the same. Read more about our data privacy principles here.</p>

                <h3>When surveillance goes too far</h3>
                <p>Governments take many different approaches to online surveillance: mass surveillance (collecting large swaths of data at a time), targeted surveillance (applying advanced techniques focused on a small, focused number of people) and surveillance by proxy (asking for information held by companies).</p>

                <p>We expect the government  to go after bad guys – it’s what helps keep us safe. But we need to trust that they’re only going after people suspected of committing a crime. When surveillance is too broad or lacks key safeguards – like getting a warrant from a judge – it can easily be abused, either accidentally or on purpose. And our personal privacy is what’s at stake.</p>

                <h3>The solution: safeguards</h3>
                <p>In order to protect our personal liberties and maintain our trust in the Internet, Mozilla proposes that government surveillance must follow three fundamental principles:</p>

                <ul class="icon-list">
                  <li>
                    <h4>Minimal impact</h4>
                    <p>Efforts should be made to collect only the information that’s needed, without compromising Internet infrastructure, technology companies’ data systems, or users’ trust.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Accountability</h4>
                    <p>Surveillance must be subject to appropriate accountability and oversight. That means being transparent and specific when it comes to requesting, routing and reporting any information collected.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>User security</h4>
                    <p>Strong encryption and security keep us safe from many kinds of criminals. Governments shouldn’t weaken the security of all in the name of spying on a few.</p>
                  </li>
              </div>

              <aside class="pullquote">
                <p class="quote">Many of the anti-privacy ‘security’ measures we're seeing — national ID cards, warrantless eavesdropping, massive data mining and so on — do little to improve, and in some cases harm, security. And government claims of their success are either wrong, or against fake threats.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <h2 class="section-title">Act before you react</h2>

              <div class="main-column">
                <p class="intro">Edward Snowden cracked open the door and the discussion about government surveillance. Reactions have varied from heads in the sand to tinfoil hats. But many people have seen it as a call to action. We all have the right to live a full online life without fear of surveillance. Rather than give up your freedom, take back your control.</p>

                <h3>Take a stand</h3>
                <p>The first thing we can all do is keep our eyes and ears out – and make our voices heard.</p>

                <ul class="icon-list">
                  <li>
                    <p>Start with a simple Google search to learn about your government’s stance on surveillance, so you can make informed decisions about your privacy. If you want to be stealthy about it, use Duck Duck Go.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Sign up for the Mozilla newsletter. We actively track issues of mass surveillance and other threats to the Web, so we’ll let you know about opportunities to speak out.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Close your blinds</h3>
                <p>These quick steps can help protect you from overbroad surveillance practices.</p>

                <ul class="icon-list">
                  <li>
                    <p>Always look for the padlock in your browser's address bar. <a href="#" class="go">Find out more</a></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Put a sticker in front of your webcam when you’re not using it.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Be careful when using a public Wi-Fi network. <a href="#" class="go">Find out more</a></p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Change your locks</h3>
                <p>Passwords are an essential tool for shielding information from prying eyes.</p>

                <ul class="icon-list">
                  <li>
                    <h4>Protect your accounts and devices with a strong PIN or password.</h4>
                    <p>Having “password” as your password is like leaving your key in the lock of your front door. Here’s some advice for creating secure passwords.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Don't use a single password everywhere.</h4>
                    <p>Using the same password for every site is akin to using the same key for your house, your car, your safety deposit box and your kid's backpack – you just wouldn’t do it. Use a password manager instead.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>For the best protection, activate 2-step authentication wherever possible. <a href="#" class="go">Find out more</a></p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="reverse">Try encryption</h3>
                <p>Encryption turns information into codes that can only be read if you have the right keys. It’s a bit like a jewelry safe. While we tend to think of healthcare and financial data as the jewels that need protecting, ask yourself: Would you want your text messages or documents to be seen by others?</p>

                <p>No software provides perfect protection from spying, but there are some easy encryption tools that provide a greater level of security than basic communications.</p>

                <h4>Phone apps</h4>
                <p>These apps use encryption to secure your phone calls, texts, picture and video communications.</p>

                    <h5>Windows</h5>
                    <p>On computers running Windows Pro, use "BitLocker." If you have the standard version of Windows, you can use a free program called DiskCryptor (see EFF’s guide "How to Encrypt your Windows Device")</p>
