					<h1>Design</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Design Principles</h2>
					<p class="fragment">just the basics</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Design is a complicated thing, and hard to teach. Most designers
						spend years studying it, but I'm going to try to tell you as much
						as I can in the time we have. The point is to get you thinking about
						design and looking for these principles.
					</aside>
				</section>

			  <section>
			    <h1>Unity</h1>
			    <p class="fragment">When all elements are in agreement and no one part is more important than the whole.</p>
			    <aside class="notes">
						Unity is one of the primary goals of design. Unfortunately it's hard
						to explain exactly how to achieve it. There are a lot of factors that
						contribute to a unified design, and numerous methods to get there.
					</aside>
			  </section>

				<section>
					<h1>Balance</h1>
          <p class="fragment">When elements are distributed in a pleasing arrangement, achieving a state of visual equilibrium.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            We have a natural sense of balance. You have juices in your head that
						slosh around and tell you when you're falling. Balance is necessary for
						survival and we can recognize it without even thinking about it. Balance
						creates a sense of harmony, where everything just "feels right."
          </aside>
				</section>

        <section>
					<section>
						<h2>Symmetry</h2>
						<img src="img/symmetry.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
						  Also known as "formal balance," each side is a mirror image of the other.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Symmetry</h2>
						<img src="img/symmetry2.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							The sides don't have to be identical mirror images, they may carry the
							same "weight" even though they differ in size, shape, color, etc.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Symmetry</h2>
						<img src="img/symmetry3.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Both sides take up about the same space and have the same level of visual
							complexity.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Symmetry</h2>
						<img src="img/symmetry4.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Even if the sides are very different there's still a sense of equal weight
							and symmetrical balance.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Asymmetry</h2>
						<img src="img/asymmetry.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
						  Also known as "informal balance." This is a sort of imbalanced balance, where
							the two sides of the design are completely different but still balance each
							other through other means, such as mass vs proximity.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Asymmetry</h2>
						<img src="img/asymmetry2.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Mass vs repetition
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Asymmetry</h2>
						<img src="img/asymmetry3.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Mass vs complexity
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Asymmetry</h2>
						<img src="img/asymmetry4.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
						  You can also deliberately upset balance to create tension.
							When you know the rules you can carefully break them.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
				  <section>
				    <h2>Not just balance</h2>
				    <aside class="notes">
							Balance is only one important part of a unified design.
							Some other principles, in rapid fire...
						</aside>
				  </section>
				  <section>
				    <h2>Repetition</h2>
				    <img src="img/repetition.png" alt="">
				    <aside class="notes">
							Establish consistency and repeat that throughout. Repeat
							it enough times and it becomes a pattern.
						</aside>
				  </section>
				  <section>
				    <h2>Patterns</h2>
				    <img src="img/repetition2.png" alt="">
				    <aside class="notes">
							Patterns and repetition establish expectations.
						</aside>
				  </section>
				  <section>
				    <h2>Similarity</h2>
				    <img src="img/repetition3.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Vary the pattern and change expectations. When similar objects
							are clustered together our eye naturally sorts them into groups.
						</aside>
				  </section>
				  <section>
				    <h2>Proximity</h2>
				    <img src="img/proximity.png" alt="">
				    <aside class="notes">
							Space between elements (or space between groups) can break up patterns
							and separate groups. Suddenly we have two distinct groups of otherwise
							identical objects simply by adding a little space.
						</aside>
				  </section>
				  <section>
				    <h2>Alignment</h2>
				    <img src="img/alignment.png" alt="">
				    <aside class="notes">
							Our eyes seem to seek out lines, and when we're mentally grouping similar
							things we want to line them up. When elements don't align it forms an
							imbalance and breaks unity (sometimes this is good, usually it's bad).
						</aside>
				  </section>
				  <section>
				    <h2>Alignment</h2>
				    <img src="img/alignment2.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Aligning elements is more naturally pleasing, even when alignment isn't perfect.
						</aside>
				  </section>
				</section>

			  <section>
			    <h1>Unity</h1>
			    <p>When all elements are in agreement and no one part is more important than the whole design</p>
			    <p class="fragment">&hellip;except when it is.</p>
			  </section>

				<section>
				  <h1>Hierarchy</h1> <h3>and</h3> <h1>Dominance</h1>
				  <p class="fragment">Create focal points and draw attention to key elements without sacrificing the unity of the whole.</p>
				  <aside class="notes">
						When you design for the web, an almost all cases, you're relaying information.
						And in almost all cases, some information is more important than other information
						on the same page. The main article is more important than the sidebar, the sidebar
						is more important than the legalese, and so on.

				  <section>
  				  <h2>Contrast</h2>
  				  <img src="img/contrast.png" alt="">
  				  <p>size and proportion</p>
  				  <aside class="notes">
  				    To make something stand out and have greater dominance, it must contrast with
							other elements that may otherwise be similar. The dominant thing might be bigger
							and take up more space.
  				  </aside>
				  </section>
          <section>
  				  <h2>Contrast</h2>
  				  <img src="img/contrast2.png" alt="">
  				  <p>color</p>
  				  <aside class="notes">
  				    Or it might be a different color.
  				  </aside>
				  </section>
          <section>
  				  <h2>Contrast</h2>
  				  <img src="img/contrast3.png" alt="">
  				  <p>complexity</p>
  				  <aside class="notes">
  				    Or has more visual complexity. The eye will be drawn to and linger over things
							that are harder to figure out.
  				  </aside>
				  </section>
				  <section>
  				  <h2>Contrast</h2>
  				  <img src="img/contrast4.png" alt="">
  				  <p>a little of everything</p>
  				  <aside class="notes">
  				    Or it might be a combination of aspects. Color, shape, complexity, breaking the
							expected pattern, etc. When the eye expects something it is drawn to things that
							don't meet that expectation.

  			    <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
  			    <p>Draw the viewer's attention to the most important content.</p>
			    </section>
			    <section>
			      <img src="img/hierarchy.png" alt="">
			      <aside class="notes">
			        This is a page without any clear hierarchy, nothing is more important than
							anything else. It's balanced and unified, but you don't know where to look
							because everything is the same. If this were a real website surely something
							on this page would be more important than the rest.
			      </aside>
			    </section>
			    <section>
			      <img src="img/hierarchy2.png" alt="">
			      <aside class="notes">
			        This version has a clear visual hierarchy. Here I'm using the both size and
							shading to make some parts stand out from the rest, but you could create this
							kind of contrast in other ways too. Color, typography, complexity, etc.
